# Peter Str√∂mberg

Hi! I am Peter, a dad (father of five), husband, developer contractor, and open source contributor. Ceator of [Calva](https://calva.io/). I regaard it curiosity as my super power along with creativity and communication. To succeed I meet challenges wielding kindness, the [Clojure](https://clojure.org) REPL, and 40 years of developer experience. I gain energy from coding and collaborating with others, fellow developers and users alike.

Clojure quite literally changed my life, and I want to pay it forwards by contributing to more developers finding out about its benefits. I am extra proud of the [Get Started With Clojure REPL](https://calva.io/get-started-with-clojure/), an interactive, editor based, introduction to this practical and wonderful programming language.
