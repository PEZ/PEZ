# Peter Strömberg

Hi! I am Peter, a dad (father of five), husband, developer contractor, open source contributor, and ceator of [Calva](https://calva.io/). My super powers are curiousity, creativity, and communication. To succeed I meet challenges wielding kindness, the [Clojure](https://clojure.org) REPL, and 40 years of developer experience. Things that give me energy are coding, collaboration, and speaking with users.

Clojure quite literally changed my life, and I want to pay it forwards by contributing to more developers finding out about its benefits. I am extra proud of the [Get Started With Clojure REPL](https://calva.io/get-started-with-clojure/), an interactive, editor based, introduction to this practical and wonderful programming language.
