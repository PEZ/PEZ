Hi! I am Peter, a dad (father of five), husband, developer contractor, open source contributor, and ceator of [Calva](https://calva.io/). My super powers are curiousity, creativity, and communication. To succeed I meet challenges wielding kindness, the [Clojure](https://clojure.org) REPL, and 40 years of developer experience. Things that give me energy are coding, collaboration, and speaking with users.
